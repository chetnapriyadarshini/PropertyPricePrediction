## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
-  We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties
 and decide whether to invest in them or not.
